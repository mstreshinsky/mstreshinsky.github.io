          <h2 class="section-heading">Part 2.0: Building blocks</h2>

          <p>Oftentimes, when someone comes up with a fabrication process for building silicon photonics wafers, they also go ahead and build a set of "building blocks." In fancy-speak, we call these building blocks part of a "design kit," or "process design kit," or "PDK" to refer to those building blocks along with guidelines for how to design circuits into their fabrication process</p>

          <p>The set of building blocks someone could come up with are, quite literally, infinite in number. In practice, there are a couple of key functions that an engineer will implement. For the sake of this blog post, in practice, I will just talk about a couple of them. What you will quickly discover though, is that a tremendous amount of things can be combined by putting these blocks together.</p>

          <p>The waveguide</p>

          <p>The splitter/combiner</p>

          <p>The phase shifter</p>

          <p>The photodetector</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Part 2.1: Blocks on blocks on blocks</h2>

          <p>Once we move past individual building blocks, engineers often assemble these blocks into standard functions:</p>

          <p>Optical modulators</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Part 2.3: Beyond the hype</h2>

          <p>So silicon photonics is pretty great, right? Well, as of early 2022, there is a good reason that all of the products based on this technology that have reached commercial success are all built for optical communication inside telecommunications or data center networks.  In general, the types of chips built for most optical communications applications are relatively simple in what they do. There are usually up to four devices on a chip that can modulate the intensity of light passing through them, a few devices to split or combine light, up to four photodetectors, a method to get light from the chip into a fiber optic cable, and some sub-assembly for a light source. Even with generous methods for determining what "counts" as a device, the number of optical devices integrated onto a single chip puts most commercial silicon photonics chips somewhere in the 1960s compared to the number of transistors on computer chips. By the 1970s, several thousand devices were on the chips being produced by Intel, IBM, and others. 
            https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor_count </p>
            
            <p>There's a tremendous amount of engineering effort that goes into designing those silicon photonics chips for optical communication. The two fundamental challenges with photonics, generally, is that it is very hard to do anything with a small amount of light and every component that light passes through loses some of it. With electronic computer chips, you can use a tiny amount of electronic charge to flip a switch--there really isn't an equivalent thing in the optical world. While there are demonstrations showing data transmission with a single-digit number of photons per bit, it takes an enormous series of electronic amplifiers to do anything meaningful with those singular photons. In terms of losing light, if you have 15 things that are all 95% transparent, you've lost more than half your light coming out the other side of those 15 things. </p>
            
            <p>In the silicon photonics world, 95% transparent is really good for most things. But now, say you have one element to bring your light from an optical fiber onto your chip, two elements to split your light four ways, three elements to modulate your light, one element to tap off a bit of your light to monitor how much of it there is, and another 4 elements to combine your light back together. This imaginary chip exists mostly for the sake of argument, but at the end of those 11 things you now have only 56% of your light left! Losing 56% of your light would still be one of the world's best chips for optical communication because achieving 95% transparency for each of those devices is a feat of engineering. </p>
            
            <p>The trick for the silicon photonics industry will be designing better and better quality devices to take that 95% up to 99%. With a set of devices that is 99% transparent, now you can use 70 different elements in a row instead of 15 and still have half your light leftover. I think this kind of performance is possible and will only be a matter of time before we see remarkably complicated systems. Until then, everything we build just has to be content with throwing away most of your light to do anything with it.
